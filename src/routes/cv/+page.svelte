			info: `This is my PhD thesis, which is mostly an extended version of my two papers together with Bart Vandereycken, together with a comphrensive preliminaries section.

			url: 'https://doi.org/10.1137/22M1515045',
			published: 'SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing',
			coauthors: ['Bart Vandereycken', 'Daniel Kressner'],
			info: `Inspired by the generalized NystrÃ¶m approximation for low-rank matrices, we created a randomized streaming algorithm for computing tensor trains. This algorithm can quickly compute accurate approximations of a wide variety of tensors (multi-dimensional arrays). It does this by 'sketching' the tensor by multiplying with random tensors to quickly find a small subspace in which it is easy to approximate the tensor. This is a streaming algorithm, which means that we only need to do a single pass over the data of the tensor we want to approximate. It also means it works really well in a distributed setting, and scales very well to big data.`

			coauthors: ['Bart Vandereycken'],
			info: `We describe how to use tensor trains to parametrize discretized functions, and how to get a useful supervised machine learning estimator out of it. Learning and initializing these tensor trains is a bit tricky, but definitely doable. I also wrote <a href="/blog/discrete_function_tensor">a blog post</a> about this paper, explaining the main ideas in a more accessible way.`

			coauthors: ['Nicolas Hemelsoet'],
			published: 'Journal of Algebra',
			info: `We apply the algorithm for the BGG resolution developed in the previous paper to compute Hochschild cohomology of blocks of the small quantum group. This allows us to study the center of the small quantum group, and our computations give stronger evidence for several conjectures concerning the small quantum group. My contribution was writing all the code needed for this project.`

This is then used to compute various thing like the Hochschild cohomology of some flag varieties. My contribution was coding the implementation of the algorithm, and solving several algorithmic problems.`

The idea is to study a toy model of principal 2-bundles and 2-transport by restricting to a stricter notion, where the fibers are all strict 2-groups. This allows to get some nice generalizations of the classical theory, which would be harder to proof in the more general setting.`
