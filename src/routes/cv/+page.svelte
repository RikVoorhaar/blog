		<p>
			Developed an augmented reality system using real-time 3d pose estimation to display holograms
			on a screen from the correct 3d perspective of a person standing next to it. This is a full
			stack project, with frontends for calibration procedures and displaying holograms, and
			backends for interfacing with hardware and numerical algorithms.
		</p>

		<p>
			Developed a 'service broker' system for monitoring and launching all our services, and to
			allow services to find each other. This system makes it much easier to start up and develop
			product demos, as well as providing a convenient place to monitor running servces. The backend
			uses a combination of our own network stack, together with FastAPI, and the frontend is
			developed in Svelte with Tailwind CSS.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maintained and upgraded the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, improving the workflow for all our Python
			projects.
		</p>

	>
		<p>
			Performed research in applied mathematics after first studying pure mathematics for 2 years.
			Focussed on advanced numerical optimization algorithms, particularly for tensors and their
			applications to machine learning. Developed 3 high-quality numerical software libraries in
			Python and contributed to 2 open-source projects as part of several research projects
			resulting in 4 manuscripts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Taught 3 courses per year as an assistant, receiving consistently positive feedback from
			students for clear solutions and lectures. Designed Python programming homework using Jupyter
			and unit tests for 5 courses well-received by both students and teaching staff.

			url: 'https://doi.org/10.1137/22M1515045',
			published: 'SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing',
			coauthors: ['Bart Vandereycken', 'Daniel Kressner'],
			info: `Inspired by the generalized NystrÃ¶m approximation for low-rank matrices, we created a randomized streaming algorithm for computing tensor trains. This algorithm can quickly compute accurate approximations of a wide variety of tensors (multi-dimensional arrays). It does this by 'sketching' the tensor by multiplying with random tensors to quickly find a small subspace in which it is easy to approximate the tensor. This is a streaming algorithm, which means that we only need to do a single pass over the data of the tensor we want to approximate. It also means it works really well in a distributed setting, and scales very well to big data.`

			coauthors: ['Bart Vandereycken'],
			info: `We describe how to use tensor trains to parametrize discretized functions, and how to get a useful supervised machine learning estimator out of it. Learning and initializing these tensor trains is a bit tricky, but definitely doable. I also wrote <a href="/blog/discrete_function_tensor">a blog post</a> about this paper, explaining the main ideas in a more accessible way.`

			coauthors: ['Nicolas Hemelsoet'],
			published: 'Journal of Algebra',
			info: `We apply the algorithm for the BGG resolution developed in the previous paper to compute Hochschild cohomology of blocks of the small quantum group. This allows us to study the center of the small quantum group, and our computations give stronger evidence for several conjectures concerning the small quantum group. My contribution was writing all the code needed for this project.`

The idea is to study a toy model of principal 2-bundles and 2-transport by restricting to a stricter notion, where the fibers are all strict 2-groups. This allows to get some nice generalizations of the classical theory, which would be harder to proof in the more general setting.`
